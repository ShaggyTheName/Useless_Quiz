The Good:

- We really enjoyed working with each other.
- We were very flexible with new ideas.
- We were very respectful with each other.
- We're all happy with our final product



The Bad:

- We weren't taught enough PHP, so it was very difficult for us to make a quiz with it. In our opinion, we should've looked at PHP a week before we started the project. 2 days weren't enough. 





The Ugly:

- We lost a brother on the way..... Yasser. Due to his lack of knowledge of PHP. He missed the days where we got the material from the trainers, so he was behind. He decided to leave, so he could learn by himself with the trainers.
